# Pat Menu 2 
Pat Menu is an easy to use menu system for Pat Winlink. It is designed to make it easier to get all of the needed componets loaded and ready to make a connection using Pat. It will also aid in finding ARDOP stations to connect to and shut down the modems once you wrap up along with many other features.

# Install
The preferred method of installation is with [Build a Pi](https://github.com/km4ack/pi-build). However, manual installation can be achieved by running the following command.

     git clone https://github.com/km4ack/patmenu2.git $HOME/patmenu2 && bash $HOME/patmenu2/setup
